Code Completion for OSS projects in phpStorm
===========================================

#### These are helper files for code completion in phpStorm with some Open Source Software that I work with.

Its important that you read the comments in each file.
-------------------------------------------------------
<pre>
* CodeIgniter   CI_phpStorm.php
* phpBB3        phpBB3.php          phpBB3 Instructions
* WordPress     wpdb_docs.php       
* WordPress     example.php         Some example fixes
</pre>

Thought I would mention I checked NetBeans 7.1 with CI and the CI_phpStorm.php helps NetBeans with code completion as well .
